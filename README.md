# hermes-deliverybot
A prototype delivery robot to be used within controled spaces like college campuses. Meant as an experimental alternative to reduce costs and complexity.

## Function

## Vision
Utilizing the OpenCV library for Python to implement efficient computer vision algorithms and image processing for enhanced navigation, this is implemented alongside a classic line follower for standard movement (explained below). Vision for this robot consists of trace and edge detection alongside ArUco marker detection to plan routes and know its position.
